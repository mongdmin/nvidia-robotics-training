# Robotics Foundations

This section summarizes the foundational concepts of autonomous robotics,
based on NVIDIA Robotics Training.

The focus is on understanding how autonomous robots are designed, how they
interact with the world, and how classical robotics concepts connect to
modern Physical AI.

## 1. What Are Autonomous Robots?

Autonomous robots are systems capable of perceiving their environment,
making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human control.

They are widely used across industries such as:
- Manufacturing and logistics
- Healthcare and service robotics
- Agriculture
- Autonomous vehicles
- Exploration and inspection

## 2. Embodied AI

Embodied AI describes intelligence that emerges from the interaction between
a physical body, sensors, and the environment.

Autonomous robots follow a continuous loop:

- Perception: Sensing and interpreting the environment
- Cognition: Reasoning, planning, and decision-making
- Action: Physical interaction through actuators

This loop forms the foundation of robot autonomy.

## 3. Robotic Systems Overview

Robots are complex systems that require tight integration between hardware
and software components.

### Hardware Components
- Sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, GPS)
- Actuators (motors, servos, hydraulic systems)
- Controllers (microcontrollers, embedded systems)

### Software Components
- Perception and sensor fusion
- Localization and mapping
- Planning and control

## 4. Perception–Cognition–Action in Practice

Robots perceive the world using sensors, interpret the data through perception
algorithms, plan actions based on their goals, and execute movements through
control systems.

This architecture closely mirrors how humans interact with the environment
using senses, cognition, and physical motion.

## 5. Foundations for Modern Robotics

The concepts covered in this module form the basis for:
- Simulation-based robotics development
- Robot learning and reinforcement learning
- Physical AI and foundation-model-driven robotics
- Human–robot interaction and long-term memory systems

Understanding these fundamentals is essential before working with simulation
tools such as Isaac Sim or learning frameworks such as Isaac Lab.

## Takeaway

Robotics Foundations provides the conceptual groundwork for autonomous robots.
It connects classical robotics principles with modern AI-driven approaches,
preparing the path toward simulation, learning, and deployment of intelligent
robotic systems.
