# NVIDIA Robotics Training – Physical AI Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through NVIDIA Robotics Training,
focusing on Physical AI, simulation, and robot learning.

## Learning Path
- Robotics Foundations (USD, Physical AI)
- Isaac Sim (Simulation & Synthetic Data)
  - [Chapter 01: Building Your First Robot](./02_isaac_sim/01_building_your_first_robot/)
  - [Chapter 02: Ingesting Robot Assets and Simulating Your Robot](./02_isaac_sim/02_Assets_and_simulating/)
- Isaac Lab (Robot Learning & RL)
- Isaac ROS (ROS2 & Deployment)

## Goal
- Build simulation-to-learning pipelines
- Train robots using reinforcement learning
- Create a research-ready robotics portfolio
